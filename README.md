# Welcome to Receiptable! ðŸ‘‹

## Project Overview

Receiptable is a React Native project built with Expo, designed to simplify expense tracking for students and families. Managing receipts and expenses can be challenging, especially with the clutter of paper. Our goal is to create a user-friendly solution that consolidates all your small and large expenses in one place.

Receiptable is a mobile app that allows users to scan receipts and documents, correcting for camera distortions while employing text recognition to automatically categorize expenses such as groceries, shopping, and transportation. As users engage with the app, it learns from their purchasing habits and visualizes insights over time, helping them make informed financial decisions.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies: ```bash npm install```
3. Start the app using Expo: ```bash expo start```
